# Welcome to Price_tracker!

Hi! I'm **Mayank Pandey**. This is my mini project in the journey of learning python. In this project I have used the power of **Python** and **BeautifulSoup**.
This project is used to track the price of products on amazon which you would be planning to buy, as we see the prices of items fluctuate every time. This program will help you get the lowest price of the item and will notify you when price drops below your desired amount.

- [EMAIL] - Your gmail on which you want to recieve the price update.
- [PASSWORD] - Your gmail app password.
