# Welcome !

Hi! I'm **Mayank Pandey**. This is my mini project in the journey of learning python. In this project I have used the power of **Python**, **Flask** and **sqlite**.
This is a simple website made in python with flask which is used as a library where you can keep your favourite books and give them ratings. The books are stored in sql database.
